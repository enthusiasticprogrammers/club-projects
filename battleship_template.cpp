/* BattleShip Code Template
Feel free to modify the code however you wish however, try to use the variables to
handle all input and output from the user for now. When we actually get people to
test their program vs eachother, other libraries will be included so cin/cout will
not be necessary.

You do not have to use the functions defined at the bottom. Instead, if you wish
you can simply program only 2 functions: setup and decision. These should be the
only unique code between different people since most of the action occurs here.

The setup function should be responsible for placing the ships on your grid.
The decision function should be responsible for choosing your next move.

Note instead of sending a letter and a number. we will be sending 2 numbers instead.
This will allow us to easily change the size of the board to have more fun games.
In a test on my laptop, 2 computers could play 1 million games in 10 minutes 30 seconds.
That being said, I would recommend creating algorithms that can still work if we add
more ships into the game and create a larger field.

When gathering a response of hit/miss/destroyed we instead reply with a number
0, 1, or 2 instead of the letters. However, how you decide to handle the data is up
to you.
